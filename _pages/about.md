I am a biomedical engineer and neuroscientist interested in deciphering the role of the neuromodulators dopamine and serotonin in learning and cognitive flexibility. I use neurophysiology and the machine learning framework of distributional reinforcement learning to elucidate the computational and neural circuit mechanisms through which they modulate learning, cognitive states, and behavioral adaptability. 

My research bridges the gap between biological and artificial intelligence.


I did my integrated master's degree (i.e. Bologna bachelor+master) in Biomedical Engineering at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) in Lisbon, Portugal, and later joined the [MIT-Portugal](https://mitportugal.org/) program to obtain my Ph.D. degree in Bioengineering Systems from a consortium of Portuguese universities. My graduate research was developed in the budding [Champalimaud Research](https://fchampalimaud.org/champalimaud-research) at the [Champalimaud Foundation](https://fchampalimaud.org/) under the supervision of Dr. Zachary F. Mainen. 

Since 2017 I have been a Postdoctoral Fellow with Prof. Naoshige Uchida at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). I am affiliated to the [Center for Brain Science](https://cbs.fas.harvard.edu/) and the [Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology](https://www.mcb.harvard.edu/), where I have had the opportunity to collaborate with researchers from different schools.
