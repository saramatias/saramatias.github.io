======

I am a biomedical engineer and neuroscientist interested in deciphering the role of the neuromodulators dopamine and serotonin in learning and cognitive flexibility. I use neurophysiology and the machine learning framework of distributional reinforcement learning to elucidate the computational and neural circuit mechanisms through which they modulate learning, cognitive states, and behavioral adaptability. My research bridges the gap between biological and artificial intelligence. 


Research
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
